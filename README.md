# DNA-accelerated-research-petition

The purpose of this repo is to create a petition or other
document to solicit 
for a much accelerated development of DNA 
information using the same parallel efforts that
Venter used to map the first comprehensive genome.

The work itself is extremely practical, but difficult
to pursuade the concept, and expensive to perform.  However, the benefits are also
extreme and pro-humanity for all.  

summary:  there are 3.2 billion gene pairs.  There are 
approximately 28,000 genes.  Most DNA work is being done
in fiefdoms and serially, although some companies have 
arrays of sequencers.  Consider the LOE ( level of effort )
it will take to complete the 3D mapping of 3.2 billion pairs.
Then assigning function to each- including what is formerly junk
DNA.  Then finding codependence interactions.  Then examining
the molecules for ways to have other chemicals join for
positive purpose.  Finally, designing, and making and testing
the chemicals ( bio and other ), followed by decades of
test and manufacturer.

This can be speeded up significantly in a practical way with
money to parallelize all the efforts.  In 10 years, the results
could conceivably make the lives of Billions of people better, and
save potentially billions of lives.

The first idea is to move approx 50 billions ($) per year from
DoD to this massive effort.  Approx 50,000 PhD/MD MORE graduates
would be needed each year.  Because of the bio and chemical warfare
research that Dod does, this could mostly be considered as a major
effort of National Defense.

It's been 18 years since the first Venter map.   And look at the 
slow serial development.  At the present rate, it could well 
take another 50, 75 or 100 years to realize real useful results,
other than drug companies simply stringing slow death along.

I'm looking for the community to carry this forward.

thx..
